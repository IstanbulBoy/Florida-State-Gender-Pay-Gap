Florida-State-Gender-Pay-Gap
============================

There is a general belief that women are paid less than men for doing the same work.  But it's hard to get
good statistics for this, as most payroll data is confidential.

The State of Florida, however, publishes its entire payroll as part of its open government initiative.  Thus,
we can examine the entire payroll to see if we can find signs of such bias.

This is an R application that will download the data, analyze it, and generate a report using the up-to-the-week
data as provided by the state.

The file GenderBias.Rmd is the "root" of the project; it contains the report as well as makes all the calls to the support
functions necessary to do the analysis.
